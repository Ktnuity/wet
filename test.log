Test 10 | ./wet --help
wet is a stack-based scripting language used to set-up projects or codebases immediately after a vcs clone.
It's:
  - At some points a pre-build.
  - At other parts a post-build.
  - You may even call it a build-system.

In other terms, wet is a collection of tasks you'd usually see run in a project to initialize tools and set up for active
 development. It could be downloading a file, unzipping that file, placing some of its content in different locations,
 making everything simple for the new user by doing all the small work for you.

It's sort of there in the name. *wet* is the liquid as it's poured from the kettle into every cup of the dozens of
 people visiting you. You shouldn't need to do it yourself, *wet* is the servant you've hired to do it for you,
 and it does exactly as you've told it to.

Commands:
    --help, show this menu
    --version, show wet version
    --license, show wet license
